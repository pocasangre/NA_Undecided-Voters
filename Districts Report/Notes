# Notes on data

The public opinion data comes from the Nationscape/UCLA survey. The raw data set with thorough documentation and codebooks can be found here https://www.voterstudygroup.org/data/nationscape.

Demographic data comes from the 2020 census and the American Community Survey (ACS). 

The 2022 districts were created using the block equivalency files provided by the census. These can be found here: https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/2023/dec/rdo/118-congressional-district-bef.html

The figures in the report are created with Datawrapper. The R code creates the necessary csv files that are then linked to Datawrapper to create the figures.
