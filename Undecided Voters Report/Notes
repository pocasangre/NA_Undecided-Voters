# Notes on data

The public opinion data comes from the Nationscape/UCLA survey. The raw data set with thorough documentation and codebooks can be found here https://www.voterstudygroup.org/data/nationscape.
The cleaned dataset used for the report is too big for github and can be made available upon request.

The figures in the report are created with Datawrapper. The R code creates the necessary csv files that are then linked to Datawrapper to create the figures. 

Classification of districts into Democratic, Republican, or competitive comes from The Cook Political Report. 

Electoral data comes from the MIT Election Lab.
